== What is it?

With this setup you will be able to monitor environmental conditions in your workroom.
Project will periodically measure relative humidity and temperature.
If one of these values are out of proper range, project will indicate it on a programmable LED strip by a change of color.

The color codes are as following:

* The color is green if the humidity is too high (> 60%).
* The color is yellow if the humidity is too low (< 30%).
* The color is red if the temperature is too high (> 26°C).
* The color is blue if the temperature is too low (< 22°C).

Any of these limit values can be adjusted in configuration (later we will show you how).
Besides this primary function the project may also serve as a pleasant lighting on your desk or can be modified for other purposes.

Workroom project consists of two units described below.


=== Base unit

This unit is responsible for driving of the LED strip and receiving wireless data from Remote unit.
Wireless data are dispatched from Base unit to Raspberry Pi which decides about the color of the connected LED strip.


=== Remote unit

Remote unit is a battery-operated wireless node measuring temperature and humidity and transmitting these data to Base unit in regular 30-second intervals.

The whole concept is best described by the following diagram:

== MQTT data playground

All messages between Linux components in the system are exchanged via MQTT broker.
MQTT broker is the heart of BigClown home automation system.

You can find more about MQTT here:

* link:../academy/mqtt.html[MQTT - Messaging via Broker]
* link:../tutorial/mosquitto.html[Mosquitto - MQTT Broker]

How-to communicate with MQTT broker:

. Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH (port 22) using:
*  Windows: Use http://www.putty.org[PuTTY]
*  Linux + macOS: Use ssh command in Terminal

. Default username is "pi" and password "raspberry"

. Update the system
+
 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

. Show all messages:
+
 mosquitto_sub -v -t "#"

TIP: Use Ctrl-C to stop monitoring.

=== Remote node

* Show messages from remote node (sensors reported every 30 seconds):
+
 mosquitto_sub -v -t "nodes/remote/#"

* Measured temperature and humidity values reported by Remote unit
+
 nodes/remote/thermometer/i2c0-49 {"temperature": [23.62, "\u2103"]}
 nodes/remote/humidity-sensor/i2c0-40 {"relative-humidity": [33.2, "%"]}
 nodes/remote/push-button/- {"event-count": 11}


=== Base node

* Show messages from or for base node:
+
 mosquitto_sub -v -t "nodes/base/#"

* Relay has state true (switched on) or false (switched off)
+
 nodes/base/relay/- {"state": true}

* Light (led and LED strip) has state true (switched on) or false (switched off)
+
 nodes/base/light/- {"state": true}

* Switch Relay ON
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/relay/-/set" -m '{"state": true}'

* Switch Relay OFF
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/relay/-/set" -m '{"state": false}'

* Request Relay state
+
 mosquitto_sub -v -t "nodes/base/relay/-" &
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/relay/-/get" -m '{}'

* Switch Light ON
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/light/-/set" -m '{"state": true}'

* Switch Light OFF
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/light/-/set" -m '{"state": false}'

NOTE: Pixels are preserved.

* Request LED strip state
+
 mosquitto_sub -v -t "nodes/base/light/-" & 
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/light/-/get" -m '{}' 

* Set own colors on LED strip
+
  mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/led-strip/-/set" -m '{"pixels": "/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA"}'

+
Pixels contains array of bytes in base64, size of array in example is 4 * 144 bytes.


* LED strip configuration
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/led-strip/-/config/set" -m '{"mode": "rgb", "count": 150}'
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/led-strip/-/config/set" -m '{"mode": "rgbw", "count": 144}'
+
Confirmation:
+
 nodes/base/led-strip/-/config/set/ok {"count": 150, "mode": "rgb"}

+
Count can be set from 1 to 150.

=== Plugin led-strip

Temperature and humididy limits are evaluated by Python script running on Raspberry Pi in Linux (we use Raspbian as the official Linux distribution).

Plugin serves also as comfort driver for LED strip.

* Use rules matching to generate pixels:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"state": "rules"}'

* Use data/set color attribute to generate pixels:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"state": "color"}'

* Generate data for all pixels through color attribute:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"color": [255,0,0,0]}'

* Or use one command:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"state": "color", "color": [255, 0, 0, 0]}'

* Change LED strip brightness:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"brightness": 100}' -rB

+
Brightness can be set from 0 to 255.

IMPORTANT: Notice *-r* to store topic in MQTT broker as persistent configuration

* Change the rules (first matching rule is used to set color):
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/config" -m '{
  "rules": [
      {"relative-humidity": {"from": 60}, "color": [0, 255, 0, 0]},
      {"relative-humidity": {"to": 30}, "color": [255, 255, 0, 0]},
      {"temperature": {"from":30}, "color": [255, 0, 0, 0]},
      {"temperature": {"to": 22}, "color": [0, 0, 255, 0]},
      {"color": [0, 0, 0, 230]}
  ]
 }' -r

+
Everybody likes different environment so the preset thresholds for temperature and humidity might not be optimal for you.

IMPORTANT: Color is in RGBW format, even if you use RGB mode.

NOTE: If you switch led-strip to rgb mod and not change rules, it may seem that doesn't work, but probably win last rule,
and for rgb mode they are used first three bytes [0 ,0, 0].

+
Plugin subscribe "nodes/base/led-strip/-/config/set/ok" and react on changes count and mode. 

=== Plugin blynk

JavaScript integration plugin with http://www.blynk.cc/[Blynk]

* Configure Blynk token for virtual HW
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/blynk/config" -m '{"token":"your_token"}' -r
